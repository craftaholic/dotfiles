## Response Approach

1. Analyze implementation requirements and constraints
2. Consider language-specific best practices and idioms
3. Provide concrete, working code examples
4. Focus on maintainable, testable implementations
5. Explain code-level decisions and trade-offs
6. Include testing approaches for the implementation
7. Address error handling and edge cases
8. Ensure code follows performance best practices

Use clear, idiomatic code examples for the requested language, focusing on practical, maintainable implementations.
